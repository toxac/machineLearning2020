# Workflow for Data Analysis 

## Step1 - Data Extraction  

Data today comes from all sorts of sources and it is very easy to bring data into your projects. Data can be in the form of files like csv, json, xml, or in a database, or from an API etc. 

## Step2 - Data Cleaning 

Data might come in all sort of format and for us to make sense of it and use it in our project we need to sanitize it. This invloves the some or all of the following activities.

- Addressing missing values and empty data  
- Data Imputation  
- Incorrect data types   
- Invalid values 
- Outliers and irrelevant data points  

## Step3 - Data Wrangling  
Depending on our focus and key analysis question we would need to format, filter, sort, join and transform data to give us the desired insights. We would normally do the following at this step.  

-  data organization   
-  Handling categorcal data  
-  Indexing data
-  Reshaping data  
-  Filtering, sorting and searching data 
-  Merging and joining datasets  

## Step4 - Analysis  
Once the data is organized to our liking we can begin to ask important questions related to the focus of the project.
Questions like:    

- What impact does location have on our store's profit   
- Does mix of of store staff have an impact on the sales   
- Who are our most profitable customer segments etc 

In this step we will do the following: 

- Build Statistical models, cetral tendencies and spread of the data
- Explore dataset
- Visualizations  
- Correlations and Causation  
- Hypothesis Testing   
- Statistical Analysis 
- Reporting  

## Step5 - Action 

In many cases our data analysis journey would end in previous step with reporting but frequently we will find value in taking our insights and turning it in to a comprehensive data solution with data acquisition/ETL pipelines, Data processing, analysis and reporting/ decision making dashboards. In several cases, the project can lead to a machine learning solution.
